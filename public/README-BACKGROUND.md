# Background Image Setup

To display the custom background image on the homepage:

1. Upload your `freepik.png` image to this `public/` directory
2. The image should be named exactly `freepik.png`
3. Recommended image size: At least 1920x1080 pixels for best quality on all screens
4. The image will be automatically styled with:
   - Full width and height coverage
   - Center positioning
   - No repeat
   - Semi-transparent dark overlay for text readability

The HomePage component is already configured to use `/freepik.png` as the background image.
